[tmc2209 stepper_x]
uart_pin: PD0
#   The pin connected to the TMC2208 PDN_UART line. This parameter
#   must be provided.
#tx_pin: 
#   If using separate receive and transmit lines to communicate with
#   the driver then set uart_pin to the receive pin and tx_pin to the
#   transmit pin. The default is to use uart_pin for both reading and
#   writing.
interpolate: True
#   If true, enable step interpolation (the driver will internally step
#   at a rate of 256 micro-steps). The default is True.
run_current: 1.0
#   The amount of current (in amps) to configure the driver to use
#   during stepper movement. This parameter must be provided.
hold_current: 0.500
#   The amount of current (in amps) to configure the driver to use
#   when the stepper is not moving. The default is to use the same
#   value as run_current.
#sense_resistor: 0.110
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the motor sense resistor. The default
#   is 0.110 ohms.
stealthchop_threshold: 999999
#   The velocity (in mm/s) to set the "stealthChop" threshold to. When
#   set, "stealthChop" mode will be enabled if the stepper motor
#   velocity is below this value. The default is 0, which disables
#   "stealthChop" mode.
#uart_address: 1
#   The address of the TMC2209 chip for UART messages (an integer
#   between 0 and 3). This is typically used when multiple TMC2209
#   chips are connected to the same UART pin. The default is zero.

#driver_SGTHRS: 0
#   Set the given register during the configuration of the TMC2209
#   chip. This may be used to set custom motor parameters. The
#   defaults for each parameter are next to the parameter name in the
#   above list.
