[bltouch]
sensor_pin: ^PE4
#   Pin connected to the BLTouch sensor pin. Most BLTouch devices
#   require a pullup on the sensor pin (prefix the pin name with "^").
#   This parameter must be provided.
control_pin: PB5
#   Pin connected to the BLTouch control pin. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pin_move_time: 0.680
#   The amount of time (in seconds) that it takes the BLTouch pin to
#   move up or down. The default is 0.680 seconds.
stow_on_each_sample: False
#   This determines if Klipper should command the pin to move up
#   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
#   sequence. Read the directions in docs/BLTouch.md before setting
#   this to False. The default is True.
probe_with_touch_mode: True
#   If this is set to True then Klipper will probe with the device in
#   "touch_mode". The default is False (probing in "pin_down" mode).
#pin_up_reports_not_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports the probe in a "not
#   triggered" state after a successful "pin_up" command. This should
#   be True for a genuine BLTouch; some BLTouch clones may require
#   False.  The default is True.
pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: False
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports a "triggered" state after
#   the commands "pin_up" followed by "touch_mode". This should be
#   True for a genuine BLTouch; some BLTouch clones may require
#   False. The default is True.
#set_output_mode:
#   Request a specific sensor pin output mode on the BLTouch V3.0 (and
#   later). This setting should not be used on other types of probes.
#   Set to "5V" to request a sensor pin output of 5 Volts (only use if
#   the controller board needs 5V mode and is 5V tolerant on its input
#   signal line). Set to "OD" to request the sensor pin output use
#   open drain mode. The default is to not request an output mode.
x_offset: 26.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
y_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
z_offset: 2.060
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
#speed:
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.
[bed_mesh]
speed: 180
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
mesh_min: 19,12
#min_point: 19,32
#min_point: 0,32
#   Defines the minimum x,y coodinate of the mesh for rectangular beds.  This
#   that this does not necessarily define the last point probed, only
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This will be the first
#   the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
#   point probed, nearest to the origin. This parameter must be provided for
#   rectangular beds.
mesh_max: 199,200
#max_point: 199,212
#max_point: 175,198
#   Defines the maximum x,y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular beds.
#   Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will be the
#   furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter must be
#   provided for rectangular beds.
probe_count: 5,5
#   A comma separated pair of integer values (X,Y) defining the number
#   of points to probe along each axis. A single value is also valid,
#   in which case that value will be for both axes. Default is 3,3
#   which probes a 3x3 grid.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The z-axis position in which to start phasing z-adjustment out.
#   Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorthm to use. May be either "langrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algoritm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.
